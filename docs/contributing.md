## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow standard Go conventions
- Use `gofmt` for formatting
- Run `make lint` to check for issues
- Add comments for exported functions and types

### Commit Messages

```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test changes
- `chore`: Build/tooling changes

Examples:
```
feat(controller): add support for custom metrics
fix(worker): resolve memory leak in heartbeat manager
docs(api): update ShardConfig specification
```

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Add integration tests for complex features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Aim for good test coverage

### Documentation

- Update relevant documentation for changes
- Add examples for new features
- Keep API documentation current
- Update troubleshooting guide if needed

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

- [ ] Tests pass (`make test`)
- [ ] Code is formatted (`make fmt`)
- [ ] Linting passes (`make lint`)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Commit messages follow convention

### PR Requirements

1. **Clear Description**: Explain what the PR does and why
2. **Issue Reference**: Link to related issues
3. **Testing**: Describe how changes were tested
4. **Breaking Changes**: Clearly mark any breaking changes
5. **Documentation**: Update docs for user-facing changes

### Review Process

1. **Automated Checks**: All CI checks must pass
