# Docker Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the Docker implementation for the Kubernetes Shard Controller project.

## Created Files

### Dockerfile Files

1. **`Dockerfile`** - Multi-stage Dockerfile that can build both components
   - Uses build argument `COMPONENT` to determine which component to build
   - Supports both manager and worker builds
   - Optimized for flexibility

2. **`Dockerfile.manager`** - Dedicated Dockerfile for the manager component
   - Optimized specifically for the manager binary
   - Includes health checks and proper labels
   - Production-ready configuration

3. **`Dockerfile.worker`** - Dedicated Dockerfile for the worker component
   - Optimized specifically for the worker binary
   - Includes health checks and proper labels
   - Production-ready configuration

### Configuration Files

4. **`.dockerignore`** - Docker ignore file to optimize build context
   - Excludes unnecessary files from build context
   - Reduces build time and image size
   - Follows best practices

5. **`docker-compose.yml`** - Docker Compose configuration for local development
   - Includes manager and worker services
   - Optional monitoring stack (Prometheus + Grafana)
   - Proper networking and volume mounts

6. **`monitoring/prometheus.yml`** - Prometheus configuration for metrics collection
   - Configured to scrape manager and worker metrics
   - Optimized scrape intervals and timeouts

### Scripts

7. **`scripts/build-images.sh`** - Comprehensive Docker build script
   - Supports building individual or all components
   - Configurable registry, tags, and platforms
   - Includes push functionality
   - Multi-architecture support

### Documentation

8. **`docs/docker.md`** - Complete Docker guide
   - Building and running instructions
   - Configuration options
   - Security best practices
   - Troubleshooting guide

### CI/CD

9. **`.github/workflows/docker.yml`** - GitHub Actions workflow
   - Automated Docker builds on push/PR
   - Multi-architecture builds
   - Security scanning with Trivy
   - Pushes to GitHub Container Registry

### Makefile Updates

10. **Updated `Makefile`** - Added Docker build targets
    - `docker-build` - Build all images
    - `docker-build-manager` - Build manager image
    - `docker-build-worker` - Build worker image
    - `docker-push` - Push images to registry
    - `kind-load` - Load images into kind cluster

## Image Characteristics

### Base Images
- **Build Stage**: `golang:1.24-alpine` - Minimal Go build environment
- **Runtime Stage**: `gcr.io/distroless/static:nonroot` - Minimal, secure runtime

### Security Features
- Non-root user (UID 65534)
- Distroless base image (no shell, minimal attack surface)
- Read-only filesystem where possible
- Minimal dependencies
- Security labels and metadata

### Size Optimization
- Multi-stage builds to minimize final image size
- Manager image: ~43MB
- Worker image: ~41MB
- Efficient layer caching
- Optimized .dockerignore

### Build Arguments
- `VERSION` - Version string for the binary
- `COMMIT` - Git commit hash
- `BUILD_DATE` - Build timestamp
- `COMPONENT` - Component to build (for multi-stage Dockerfile)

## Usage Examples

### Building Images

```bash
# Build all images
make docker-build

# Build with custom registry
REGISTRY=myregistry.com make docker-build

# Build using script with options
./scripts/build-images.sh --registry myregistry.com --tag v1.0.0 --push

# Build for multiple platforms
./scripts/build-images.sh --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64
```

### Running Containers

```bash
# Run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Run individual containers
docker run -d --name shard-manager \
  -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 \
  -v ~/.kube:/home/nonroot/.kube:ro \
  shard-controller/manager:latest

# Run with custom configuration
docker run -d --name shard-worker \
  -e SHARD_ID=worker-1 \
  -e LOG_LEVEL=debug \
  shard-controller/worker:latest
```

### Deployment

```bash
# Load into kind cluster
make kind-load

# Update Kubernetes deployment
kubectl set image deployment/shard-manager \
  manager=shard-controller/manager:v1.0.0 \
  -n shard-system
```

## Testing and Validation

### Build Testing
```bash
# Validate Docker builds
./scripts/validate-quickstart.sh

# Test image functionality
docker run --rm shard-controller/manager:latest --help
docker run --rm shard-controller/worker:latest --help
```

### Security Testing
```bash
# Scan for vulnerabilities
trivy image shard-controller/manager:latest
trivy image shard-controller/worker:latest
```

### Runtime Testing
```bash
# Test with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f

# Test health endpoints
curl http://localhost:8081/healthz
curl http://localhost:8083/healthz
```
